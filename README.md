well i meant Book = The Bible (main theme of The Book of Eli film)

:)

i&#39;m making a film btw

it&#39;s about the lack of connection between people due to technological communication advancement

which gets rid of the physical presence of a person

for instance it would be so much cooler if i could talk to you personally

than through sentences bearing meaning

but no essence

thats a good idea...its true

00:29Me

it&#39;s about a guy who wants to break through the pattern and regain the connection

by passion, maybe anger, overcoming addictions

00:30Polly

cool

to the &#39;virtual&#39; online reality

as in only the general notion of the Internet/network/system/pattern

all-connected

all-modifiable

all-accessible

the network that robs people of the intermediary: the physical interaction and responsiveness
